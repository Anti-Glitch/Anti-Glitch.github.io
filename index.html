            Todays top news: Florida Man
            tries to rob bank with a water gun, 
            ends in death involving
            accountant pulling out katana.
        </h2>

        <p>
            And today we have reports from the police
            that 11/12 year old Jakob Mchenry, the boy
            who ran over his dog, cat, and hamster with
            a lawnmower, has yet again broken stupidness.
            Witnesses say that Jakob ran in the bank with
            a super soaker threatening to shoot the
            accountant if he didn't turn over the money.
            What Jakob didn't know was that the accountant
            had a katana hidden up his shirt. The accountant
            grabbed a katana and started chasing Jakob around
            with it. Jakob ran away
            but was soon caught by the police, probably 
            because Jakob's getaway vehicle was a plastic princess
            bike. Jakob was charged with attempted murder and stupidity.
            Lets hope that Jakob will soon grow a brain.
