        <h2>
            Todays top news: Florida Man
            tries to rob bank with a water gun, 
            ends in death involving
            accountant pulling out katana.
        </h2>

        <p>
            And today we have reports from the police
            that 11/12 year old Jakob Mchenry, the boy
            who ran over his dog, cat, and hamster with
            a lawnmower, has yet again broken stupidness.
            Witnesses say that Jakob ran in the bank with
            a super soaker threatening to shoot the
            accountant if he didn't turn over the money.
            What Jakob didn't know was that the accountant
            had a katana hidden up his shirt. The accountant
            grabbed a katana and started chasing Jakob around
            with it. Jakob ran away
            but was soon caught by the police, probably 
            because Jakob's getaway vehicle was a plastic princess
            bike. Jakob was charged with attempted murder and stupidity.
            Lets hope that Jakob will soon grow a brain.

        <h3>Todays topic: The flying pill!</h3>
        <h4>Cast - Rob Radical(A.K.A. Radical Rob) and his friends</h4>
        <h5>The sceen begins on top of a building</h5>
        <p class = "Skit-Text">Rob Radical : Howdy folks! It's me Rob Radical! Remember me? No? I guess I wasn't as famous as I thought.
            Well anyways, I've brought some of my friends with me today. Here they are: 'Crickets Chirping'.
            Whispers: You can do this by yourself Rob. You can do it.
            Well your probably wondering, what is Rob Radical doing here holding a innocent man hostage?
            Man : Please help.
            Rob : Well I'm here to demonstrate my new product, the flying pill!
            Your probably wondering, what does it do? It makes you fly! And I'm going to demostrate it to
            this hostage right here. Now, how do you take it? It's actually simple and not complicated
            at all. Remember you have to do exactly what I do. EXACTLY. Now take the jar and twist open
            the cap with a force of exacty 25 newtons. Then lift it with a force upward towards your mouth
            at 30 newtons, taking acount of the air friction in between. Then take one pill and put it in 
            your mouth. Drink exactly 1 cup of water and swallow the pill. Oh, and you have to do this in 
            exactly 5 minutes and 32 seconds. Now how does it work? Simple. We just put some dirt and grass
            and some other stuff we found on the ground into it. It's simply mother natures power.
            Screen : Shows picture of earth filled with fires and pollution and trash.
            Rob : Such beauty. Anyways, here goes! *Stuffs hostage with a flying pill*
            Hostage : Chokes and swallows.
            Rob : 1 minute after consuming, you will start to slowly float.
            Hostage : Wow, I'm floating!
            Rob : 2 minutes after consuming, you will start to fly uncontrollably. This is the most dangerous
            part.
            Hostage : *Slams into tree*
            Rob : 3 minutes after consuming, you will still fly wildly, but not as much. So now 
            you flying wildly, mildly. Heh. Get it? No? *Whispers* I guess I'm not as funny as I thought I was.
            Hostage : Hey it's not as crazy anymore! *Gets slammed into the ground again and again*
            I guess not.
            Rob : 4 minutes after consuming, you will gain full control of your powers!
            Hostage : Whoo Hoo! *Starts flying down the waterfall*
            Rob : 5 minutes after consuming, the pill's affect dies out. So make sure to get back on ground!
            Hostage : Wait what? *Plummets towards the ground* Noooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            *Splat*
            Rob : Heh Heh. Well be sure to buy the flying pill.
            Guy watching commercial : Well, how much does it cost?
            Rob : Did you just ask how much does it cost? Well don't worry, one pill only costs 5 cents!
            Guy watching commercial : Wow!
            Rob : Well of course there are some other fees. The water you drink with the pill can't be 
            normal water, it has to be our special flying water. It's available for only 100 dollars.
            You also can't drink flying water directly, or it will burn your face off. Don't worry you can
            buy our special flying straw for only 1000 dollars! Oh, did I mention that back 1 minute ago
            I was talking about each <strong>separate</strong> drop of flying water being 100 dollars, and you need to drink
            one cup. Don't worry, you only need around 100,000 drops of flying water. That would make it
            10,000,000 dollars for the water. Also, you need to buy a special flying water cup for your water,
            since the water would just vaporize any normal cup immediately. And yes, the water is totally safe
            to drink, even though it can vaporize just about anything, including a hamster riding a scooter while
            dressed up as Justin Beiber, it is totally safe for your stomach. We didn't say anything about the
            throat though. Sypmtoms only occur if you are a girl. Or if you are white. Or if you are between ages of
            0 - 100000000 centuries old. Symptons include not flying, death, cancer, flu, cold, ebola, ligma, un-radical disease,
            or a mix of all of those. Anyways, the cup is available for just 6969.69 dollars. That will total out to
            be only 10007970.2 dollars. Of course, you also have to pay us a tip of 59688998.8 dollars, so it will
            actually be 69696969 dollars.
            Guy watching commercial : But I don't have that much money.
            Rob : Don't worry we'll give you a discount! Before, it was 69696969 dollars, but now, I'll give it to 
            you for 69696969696969696969696969696969696969.69696969696969696969 dollars!
            Guy watching commercial : Yay! Wait isn't that actually mo-*Gets shot buy gun and falls to the ground*
            Rob : And I guess this is the end! Rob Radical signing out homies! Make sure to buy that flying pill!
            whispers : or i'll kill you...
            Peace!
