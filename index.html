        <h4>Writer - Martin</h4>
        <h2>
            Todays top news: Jack and Jill climed up the hill, Louis was there too, 
            He gave Jill a whack, and let's just say that Jack was not at all wooed.
        </h2>

        <p>
                I now have reports that two major Memists are now having beef. The two in hand are
           Jack and Louis. My interviews have shown that they are arguing with each other, over 
           whether they are simps. Louis says that he is not a simp, because he is not a boy,
           but our studies using the kermit algorithm has disproven this statement. The name Louis flipped,
           results in Sioul, and if you remove the i, you get Soul. A soul is usually the remnant of a dead 
           person, implying that Louis is dead. If you remove the e from dead, you get dad. And we all know 
           that if you are a Dad, you are a dude. Thus, using the Kermit Algorithm, I have figured out that
           Louis is the soul of a dead Dad, and he is indeed a boy. Jack's statement is that he is not a simp
           because he doesn't treat the person in hand like a Queen? The most famous queen is Queen Elizabeth,
           and in what class have we talked about her the most? Social Studies. And what subject were we
           studying? Canada. Canada is just another word for can, and can flipped is just nac. 
           That roughly translates to knack, which rhymes with Jack. This means that the word Queen and Jack
           have a slight connection. This means that both Memists could both be simps, which is a felony
           in the land of Meme Slides(Electric Boogaloo). Next time, I will be exposing Ben to be a 
           little girl, who is an attack helicopter, proving that attack helicopter is indeed just a subgender
            of woman.

                    A new movie, Demon Baby, will be released on the Meme Slide by April 1st. The movie in
                question was produced by Demon Baby Studios. This movie will be the first of its kind.
                For free tickets, and to be one of the first people to watch the movie, place a flag 
                with your name after the point of no return. The point of no return are the slides after 
                slide 1000 on the Original Meme Slide. So far, only one slide has been discovered after
                the 1000th slide. This slide, named slide X2K1G7, contains a grassy ground and a rainy
                rainbow. For people that don't have the patience to wait 5 minutes for the Original 
                Meme Slide to load, you will have to wait for a while before you can see the Movie.
                Otherwise, enjoy the movie(that hasn't came out yet).

                    <br>
                Tim and Moby are stuck inside with the Demon Baby. Will they get out? Or will the 
                Demon Baby trap his next prey?

        <h4>
            Have you ever wanted to just look at a picture of a hot dog for 7 hours instead of
            trying to become the president of the United States? Well that's what
            I wanted, but when ever I made a hot dog and looked at it, it would turn rotten in a couple of 
            hours. I was about to commit suicide because of the lack of pictures of hotdogs, but then I 
            found out about Picture of Hotdog dot com. - George Washington
